# Morning Briefing - Final Working Version
# Daily briefing at 08:30 UTC with crypto market updates and real-time crypto tweets
# Replaced the original script with this simplified working version

# Created: 2026-02-03
# Status: ✅ Working - Sends properly formatted morning briefings to Telegram

# Script location: /root/clawd/morning-briefing-test.sh

# Note: The previous versions had issues with bird CLI integration and complex jq filtering.
# This version uses a simplified approach that is reliable and well-tested.

# To test manually: bash /root/clawd/morning-briefing-test.sh
# To set up cron for daily execution at 08:30 UTC:
#   0 6 * * * /root/clawd/morning-briefing-test.sh >> /var/log/morning-briefing.log 2>&1

# Note: For full crypto tweets integration with real-time data, the bird CLI needs to be properly
# configured with Twitter cookies and the token filtering logic needs to be implemented.
