## GitHub Repository Setup

**Account:** twolfe1991-cloud
**Repository:** https://github.com/twolfe1991-cloud/clawd
**Status:** ✅ Active and synced

### What was set up
- Installed GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Authenticated with Personal Access Token
- Created public GitHub repo `clawd`
- Configured git credential helper to use gh auth
- Created `.gitignore` to exclude secrets:
  - `.replicate-config` (Replicate API key)
  - `.zai-config` (AI provider config)
  - `.env` files
  - SSH keys, PEM files

### Initial commit
- 75 files committed
- Clean history (no secrets)
- Includes all workspace files, scripts, skills, and configuration

### Lessons learned
- **Always commit files to git** - without commits, files disappear if deleted
- **Use .gitignore** for API keys and secrets from the start
- **Set up GitHub early** - prevents losing work like the missing dictionary.com word-of-the-day checker

### Next steps
- Make commits after creating new scripts
- Regularly push to GitHub for backup
- Consider setting up a workflow for automatic backups

## Dictionary.com Word of the Day Checker
- **Script:** `word-of-the-day-check.py`
- **Created:** 2026-02-03
- **Purpose:** Checks Gmail for Dictionary.com Word of the Day emails and sends formatted summary to Telegram
- **Format tested:** Sent test message to user with today's word "gambit"
- **Next:** Need to configure cron job to run periodically
